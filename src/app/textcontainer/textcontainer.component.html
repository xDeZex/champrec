        <p>
          I don't know what else to write, so here is my Spotify account:
        </p>
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/31oeoctxoykryhide5inkvczqt4q?si=8f3c4429ef6d4e6c" target="_blank">Spotify</a>
        <p>
          I listen to a lot of music, new and old, so there is probably something new for everyone. This account is quite recent, and I haven't recreated my album collection yet.
